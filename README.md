# Hopper

## Description: 
### Problem:
As a part-time strength & conditioning coach, coming up with workouts 
can be an mental/time investment.My goal is to create an application 
to aid me in creating workouts with minimal effort on my part but with 
my criteria/taste respected.
### Solution:
Create application to randomly select crossfit/functional workouts. 
### Purpose:
Primarily a sandbox for a handful of javascript frameworks and ES6
features as well as a POC of generating workouts, in a future release,
to later pass to machine learning API.

### Technologies:
- Hapi.js: API framework
- Node.js v6.6.0: js engine
- Material Design Lite: Google's *bootstrap* library for 'look and feel'
- Handlebars: HTML template engine
- Database: TBD (Mongodb/Couchdb)
- Caching: TBD (Redis)
- Continuous Integration: [Codeship](http://www.codeship.com)
